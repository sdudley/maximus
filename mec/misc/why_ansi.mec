Maximus can optionally send "ANSI codes" to your terminal program.  If
your terminal does support ANSI, then you'll be able to use colour in
the menu prompts, cursor movement, and other niceties.

However, your terminal program must have support for these codes, or
else you'll only see a lot of garbage.  If your terminal program has
a terminal emulation mode of either "ANSI" or "VT-100", then you
should switch to it now.

Here's what ANSI codes look like:

        [[31mAAAAA        [[32mBBBBB        [[34mCCCCC[[1;37m

If you can see a bunch of numbers and square brackets, then your
terminal program does NOT support ANSI graphics, and you should answer
"N" at the prompt.

If there were three blocks of letters, with no intervening numbers, then
your terminal program DOES support ANSI, and you should answer "Y"
at the prompt.

If you own a colour monitor, then the first group of letters should be red,
the second green, and the third blue.

The answer you give here is not something that is totally permanent.
Maximus has a CHANGE SETUP menu, and you can toggle your ANSI on or off
there.
 
   To turn *on* ANSI codes, enter........... Y
   To turn *off* ANSI codes, enter.......... N
