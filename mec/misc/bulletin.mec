 This file contains a list of bulletins to be shown to the user.  The
 only restrictions for modifying this file are:

 1) There must be one {link}Misc\Bul_Hdr at the top of the file, below
    any comments.

 2) The start of each bulletin should contain the date that the
    bulletin was created, surrounded by the appropriate colour codes.

 3) The date should be followed by two blank lines, and then the
    bulletin itself.

 4) After each bulletin, you should use a {link}Misc\Bul_Next token.

 Aside from these restrictions, you can create as many different
 bulletins as you wish.
